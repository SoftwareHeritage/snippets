    create temporary view counts as
        select object_type as tbl, value as tuples
        from object_counts
        order by tbl;

    create temporary table nodes (
        description  text,
        tuples       bigint not null
    );

    create temporary table edges (like nodes);

* nodes
** content
   content nodes (skipped or not) are the leaves in the graph
   #+begin_src sql
     insert into nodes
         select 'content', sum(tuples)
         from counts
         where tbl in ('content', 'skipped_content');
   #+end_src
** revision
   revision nodes are the inner nodes of history subgraphs
   #+begin_src sql
     insert into nodes
         select 'revision', tuples
         from counts
         where tbl = 'revision';
   #+end_src
** release
   tagged release nodes are graph roots
   #+begin_src sql
     insert into nodes
         select 'release', tuples
         from counts
         where tbl = 'release';

** directory
   anonymous directory nodes
   #+begin_src sql
     insert into nodes
         select 'directory', tuples
         from counts
         where tbl = 'directory';

** snapshot
   snapshot nodes are graph entry points

** directories -> { directory, file, revision }                 :approximate:
   one edge for each directory entry (edges pointing to other directories +
   edges pointing to contents + edges pointing to revisions)
   #+begin_src sql
