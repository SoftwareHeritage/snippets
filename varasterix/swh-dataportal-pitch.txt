The Software Heritage team regularly produces datasets from the archive, including the Software Heritage Graph Dataset, as well as various derived datasets. These datasets have always been released publicly, subject to the respect of their term of use, but were previously not particularly easy to find and follow.

As the number of published datasets keeps increasing over time, and to improve their usability, we designed a novel dataset portal that lists all available datasets and their versions. The portal is now available in preview/beta mode at <https://datasets.softwareheritage.org> .

We are currently seeking feedback on the dataset portal from all users of Software Heritage datasets. Please have a look at it, look for your favorite dataset (version) in there, and let us know what you think! You can report bugs and submit feedback about the dataset portal at <https://gitlab.softwareheritage.org/swh/devel/swh-dataportal/> as well as on our general [development channels](https://www.softwareheritage.org/community/developers/).
